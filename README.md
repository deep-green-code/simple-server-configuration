Simple server configuration to keep it up to date

## Description



## How to use

@deprecated WIP

clone this repo and setup a root cron to run periodic updates.

I usually install these in `/opt`

```bash
cd /opt
# as /opt is usually owned by root you have to create the directory first
mkdir simple-server-configuration
git clone https://github.com/deep-green-code/simple-server-configuration.git
cd simple-server-configuration
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] detect OS and adapt command
- [ ] create a setup script
- [ ] list
